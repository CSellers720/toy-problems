# toy-problems

I'll post all the daily toy problems we'll be working on here.
Once we've worked through them, I'll post solutions in the "solution" folder for each problem.
Go ahead and create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repository and [clone it](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) (scroll down to "Cloning an Existing Repository") down to your local system to get started.
